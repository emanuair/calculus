Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, check out this plot:
  \begin{image}
    \includegraphics{0.png}
  \end{image}
\item[Riley] Whoa, that looks cool!
\item[Devyn] I know! Anyway, someone told me that this was a graph
  of a function, its derivative, and the derivative of the
  derivative.  Which one is which?
\item[Riley] Hmmmmm. I'm not sure.
