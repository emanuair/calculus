Our method for solving these problems is essentially the following:

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem1"><a id="x1-64r1"></a>You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume. Suppose that the
top and bottom are made of a material that is <script type="math/tex">N</script> times as expensive (cost per unit
area) as the material used for the lateral side of the cylinder. Find (in terms of <script type="math/tex">N</script>) the
ratio of height to base radius of the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the
containers. <div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem2"><a id="x1-65r2"></a>First we draw a picture: <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-1">                 <script type="math/tex">r</script><script type="math/tex">h</script><script type="math/tex">V = \pi r^2h</script>
</div>
Letting <script type="math/tex">c</script> represent the cost of the lateral side, we can write an expression for
the cost of materials: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> C = 2\pi c r h+2\pi r^{2}\answer [given]{Nc}. </script> Since we know that <script type="math/tex">V=\pi r^2h</script>, we can use this relationship
to eliminate <script type="math/tex">h</script> (we could eliminate <script type="math/tex">r</script>, but it’s a little easier if we eliminate <script type="math/tex">h</script>,
which appears in only one place in the above formula for cost). We find
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
  C(r)&=2c\pi r\frac{V}{\pi r^2}+2Nc\pi r^2\\
  &=\frac{2cV}{r}+2Nc\pi r^2.
                                                                  

                                                                  
\end{align*}</script>
Since we have expressed the cost as a function of a single variable, the problem
becomes a“calculus problem”: Find the minimum of the function <script type="math/tex">C</script> on the interval
<script type="math/tex">(0,\infty )</script>.
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent">Although the function <script type="math/tex">C</script> is continuous on its domain, its domain is an open,
unbounded interval and the Extreme Value Theorem does not apply; there is no
guarantee that the minimum even exists. But we don’t give up! Our strategy will be
to search for a critical point and check if the minimum is attained there. By
solving the equation <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> C'(r)=-2cV/r^2+4Nc\pi \answer [given]{r} =0 </script> we find that the point where <script type="math/tex">r=\sqrt [3]{V/(2N\pi )}</script> is the only critical point
of <script type="math/tex">C</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">C''(r)=4cV/r^3+4Nc\pi </script> is positive when <script type="math/tex">r</script> is positive, there is a local minimum at the
critical point, and hence a global minimum since there is only one critical
point.
</p><!--l. 90--><p class="noindent">Another way to reach this conclusion is to examine the sign of the derivative <script type="math/tex">C'(r)</script> on the
interval <script type="math/tex">(0,\infty )</script>: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> C'(r)=-2cV/r^2+4Nc\pi r=\frac {4Nc\pi (r^3-\frac {V}{2N\pi })}{r^2}. </script> From this factorization it is clear that <script type="math/tex">C'(r)<0</script> on <script type="math/tex">(0,\sqrt [3]{V/(2N\pi )})</script>, and <script type="math/tex">C'(r)>0</script> on <script type="math/tex">(\sqrt [3]{V/(2N\pi )}, \infty )</script>. This means that the
function <script type="math/tex">C</script> is decreasing on <script type="math/tex">(0,\sqrt [3]{V/(2N\pi )})</script> and increasing on <script type="math/tex">(\sqrt [3]{V/(2N\pi )}, \infty )</script>, and, therefore, has a global minimum
at the critical point.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="noindent">Finally, since <script type="math/tex">h=V/(\pi r^2)</script>, </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
\frac{h}{r}&=\frac{V}{\pi r^3}\\
&=\frac{V}{\pi(V/(2N\pi))}\\
&=\answer[given]{2N},
\end{align*}</script>
so the minimum cost occurs when the height <script type="math/tex">h</script> is <script type="math/tex">2N</script> times the radius. If, for
example, there is no difference in the cost of materials, the height is twice the
radius.

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem3"><a id="x1-66r3"></a>You want to sell a certain number <script type="math/tex">n</script> of items in order to maximize your profit. Market
research tells you that if you set the price at $<script type="math/tex">1.50</script>, you will be able to sell <script type="math/tex">5000</script> items, and for
every <script type="math/tex">10</script> cents you lower the price below $<script type="math/tex">1.50</script> you will be able to sell another <script type="math/tex">1000</script> items.
Suppose that your fixed costs (“start-up costs”) total $<script type="math/tex">2000</script>, and the per item cost of
production (“marginal cost”) is $<script type="math/tex">0.50</script>. Find the price to set per item and the number of
items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the maximum
profit you can get. <div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem4"><a id="x1-67r4"></a>The first step is to convert the problem into a function
maximization problem. The revenue for selling <script type="math/tex">n</script> items at <script type="math/tex">x</script> dollars is given by <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> r(x) = n(x)x </script> and the
cost of producing <script type="math/tex">n</script> items is given by <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> c(x) = 2000+0.5 n(x). </script> However, from the problem we see
that the number of items sold is itself a function of <script type="math/tex">x</script>, <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> n(x) =5000+\frac {1000(1.5-x)}{0.10} </script> So profit is give by:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
P(x) &= r(x) - c(x)\\
&= nx - (2000+0.5 n)\\
&=-10000x^2+25000x-12000.
\end{align*}</script>
We want to know the maximum value of the function <script type="math/tex">P</script> on the interval <script type="math/tex">[0,1.5]</script>. The Extreme
Value Theorem now guarantees that the maximum is attained, since the function <script type="math/tex">P</script> is
                                                                  

                                                                  
continuous on the closed interval, <script type="math/tex">[0,1.5]</script>. We have to find the critical points: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P'(x)=0, </script>
or <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> -20000x+25000=0, </script> which implies that the only critical point occurs at <script type="math/tex">x=1.25</script>. Now we have to
evaluate the function at the critical point and both endpoints, and compare the
values:
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex">P(0)=-12000</script>, <script type="math/tex">P(1.25)=3625</script>, and <script type="math/tex">P(1.5)=3000</script>. Note that <script type="math/tex">P(1.25)</script> is the maximum of these. Thus the maximum profit is $<script type="math/tex">3625</script>, attained
when we set the price at $<script type="math/tex">1.25</script> and sell <script type="math/tex">7500</script> items.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="noindent">Alternately, we could apply the Second Derivative Test at the critical point and
conclude that there must be a local maximum there, since <script type="math/tex">P''(x)=-20000<0</script>. Since this is the only
critical point, it must be a global maximum as well. We can confirm our results by
looking at the graph of <script type="math/tex">y=P(x)</script>: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \graph [xmin=0,xmax=3,ymin=-4000,ymax=6000]{y=-10000x^2+25000x-12000} </script>

could be is <script type="math/tex">R</script> and the largest <script type="math/tex">h</script> could be is <script type="math/tex">2R</script>.
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent">Notice that the function we want to maximize, <script type="math/tex">\pi r^2h/3</script>, depends on <em>two</em> variables. Our next
step is to find the relationship between <script type="math/tex">r</script> and <script type="math/tex">h</script> and use it to solve for one of
the variables in terms of the other, so as to have a function of only one
variable to maximize. In this problem, the condition is apparent in the figure

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem7"><a id="x1-70r7"></a>A power line needs to be run from a power station located on the beach to an

</div>
It costs $50/ft. to run a power line along the land, and $130/ft. to run a
power line under water. How much of the power line should be run along the
land to minimize the overall cost? What is the minimal cost? <div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem8"><a id="x1-71r8"></a>There are two
                                                                  

                                                                  
immediate solutions that we could consider, each of which we will reject
through “common sense.” First, we could minimize the distance by directly
connecting the two locations with a straight line. However, this requires
that all the wire be laid underwater, the most costly option. Second, we
could minimize the underwater length by running a wire all 5000 ft. along
the beach, directly across from the offshore facility. This has the undesired
effect of having the longest distance of all, probably ensuring a nonminimal
cost.
<!--l. 334--><p class="noindent">The optimal solution likely has the line being run along the ground for a while, then
underwater, as the figure implies. We need to label our unknown distances: the
distance run along the ground and the distance run underwater. Recognizing that the
underwater distance can be measured as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we can
label our figure as follows </p><div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-5">facilitystation<script type="math/tex">1000</script> ft<script type="math/tex">x</script><script type="math/tex">\sqrt {x^2+1000^2}</script><script type="math/tex">5000-x</script><script type="math/tex">5000</script> ft
</div>
By choosing <script type="math/tex">x</script> as we did, we make the expression under the square root simple. We
now create the cost function: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin {array}{ccc} \text {Cost} = & & \\ \text {land cost} & + & \text {water cost} \\ \text {\$50}\times \text {land distance} &+& \text {\$130}\times \text {water distance} \\ 50(5000-x) &+& 130\sqrt {x^2+1000^2}.\\ \end {array} </script> So we have <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> c(x) = 50(5000-x)+ 130\sqrt {x^2+1000^2}. </script> This function only makes sense on the
interval <script type="math/tex">[0,5000]</script>. While we are fairly certain the endpoints will not give a minimal cost, we
still evaluate <script type="math/tex">c(x)</script> at each to verify. <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> c(0) = 380000 \quad \quad c(5000) \approx 662873. </script> We now find the critical points of <script type="math/tex">c(x)</script>. We compute <script type="math/tex">c'(x)</script> as <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> c'(x) = -50+\frac {\answer [given]{130x}}{\sqrt {x^2+1000^2}}. </script>
Recognize that this is never undefined. Setting <script type="math/tex">c'(x)=0</script> and solving for <script type="math/tex">x</script>, we have:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
      -50+\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}} &= 0 \\
      \frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}  &= 50\\
      \frac{130^2x^2}{x^2+1000^2} &= 50^2\\
      130^2x^2 &= 50^2(x^2+1000^2) \\
      130^2x^2-50^2x^2 &= 50^2\cdot1000^2\\
      (130^2-50^2)x^2 &= 50000^2\\
      x^2 &= \frac{50000^2}{130^2-50^2}\\
      x &= \frac{50000}{\sqrt{130^2-50^2}}\\
      x &= \frac{50000}{120},
    \end{align*}</script>
Evaluating <script type="math/tex">c(x)</script> at <script type="math/tex">x=416.67</script> gives a cost of about <script type="math/tex">\$370000</script>. The distance the power line is laid along land
is <script type="math/tex">5000-416.67 = 4583.33\unit {ft}</script> and the underwater distance is <script type="math/tex">\sqrt {416.67^2+1000^2} \approx 1083\unit {ft}</script>. We can confirm out results by looking at the
graph of <script type="math/tex">y=c(x)</script>: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \graph [xmin=0, xmax=5000, ymin=0, ymax=800000]{y=50(5000-x)+130\sqrt {x^2+1000000}} </script>

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem9"><a id="x1-72r9"></a><a class="ximera-label" id="exam:sand and road"></a> Suppose you want to reach a point <script type="math/tex">A</script> that is located across the sand from a nearby
road. <div class="image-environment" role="img" aria-labelledby="image-alt-6"><script type="math/tex">A</script><script type="math/tex">D</script><script type="math/tex">B</script><script type="math/tex">C</script><script type="math/tex">b</script><script type="math/tex">x</script><script type="math/tex">w</script><script type="math/tex">v</script><script type="math/tex">a</script>

Suppose that the road is straight, and <script type="math/tex">b</script> is the distance from <script type="math/tex">A</script> to the closest point <script type="math/tex">C</script> on
the road. Let <script type="math/tex">v</script> be your speed on the road, and let <script type="math/tex">w</script>, which is less than <script type="math/tex">v</script>, be your speed
on the sand. Right now you are at the point <script type="math/tex">D</script>, which is a distance <script type="math/tex">a</script> from <script type="math/tex">C</script>. At what
point <script type="math/tex">B</script> should you turn off the road and head across the sand in order to
minimize your travel time to <script type="math/tex">A</script>? <div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem10"><a id="x1-73r10"></a>Let <script type="math/tex">x</script> be the distance short of <script type="math/tex">C</script> where you
turn off, the distance from <script type="math/tex">B</script> to <script type="math/tex">C</script>. We want to minimize the total travel time.
Recall that when traveling at constant velocity, time is distance divided by
velocity.
<!--l. 475--><p class="noindent">You travel the distance from <script type="math/tex">D</script> to <script type="math/tex">B</script> at speed <script type="math/tex">v</script>, and then the distance from <script type="math/tex">B</script> to <script type="math/tex">A</script> at speed <script type="math/tex">w</script>.
The distance from <script type="math/tex">D</script> to <script type="math/tex">B</script> is <script type="math/tex">a-x</script>. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from <script type="math/tex">B</script> to <script type="math/tex">A</script> is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \sqrt {x^2+b^2}. </script>
Hence the total time for the trip is <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> T(x)=\frac {a-x}{v}+\frac {\sqrt {x^2+b^2}}{w}. </script> We want to find the minimum value of <script type="math/tex">T</script> when <script type="math/tex">x</script> is
between 0 and <script type="math/tex">a</script>. As usual we set <script type="math/tex">T'(x)=0</script> and solve for <script type="math/tex">x</script>. Write <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> T'(x)=\answer [given]{-1/v+\frac {x}{w\sqrt {x^2+b^2}}} =0. </script> We find that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> x=\frac {wb}{\sqrt {v^2-w^2}} </script> Notice that <script type="math/tex">a</script>
does not appear in the last expression, but <script type="math/tex">a</script> is not irrelevant, since we are interested
only in critical values that are in <script type="math/tex">[0,a]</script>, and <script type="math/tex">wb/\sqrt {v^2-w^2}</script> is either in this interval or not. If it is, we can
use the second derivative to test it: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> T''(x) = \answer [given]{\frac {b^2}{(x^2+b^2)^{3/2}w}}. </script> Since this is always positive there is
a local minimum at the critical point, and so it is a global minimum as
well.
</p><!--l. 505--><p class="noindent">If the critical value is not in <script type="math/tex">[0,a]</script> it is larger than <script type="math/tex">a</script>. In this case the minimum must occur
at one of the endpoints. We can compute </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin{align*} 
T(0)&={a\over v}+{b\over w} \\
T(a)&={\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\over w}
\end{align*}</script>
but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct comparison. If, as is
likely in practice, we know the values of <script type="math/tex">v</script>, <script type="math/tex">w</script>, <script type="math/tex">a</script>, and <script type="math/tex">b</script>, then it is easy to determine this.
With a little cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum in general. We have
seen that <script type="math/tex">T''(x)</script> is always positive, so the derivative <script type="math/tex">T'(x)</script> is always increasing. We know
that at <script type="math/tex">wb/\sqrt {v^2-w^2}</script> the derivative is zero, so for values of <script type="math/tex">x</script> less than that critical value,
the derivative is negative. This means that <script type="math/tex">T(0)>T(a)</script>, so the minimum occurs when
<script type="math/tex">x=a</script>.
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 520--><p class="noindent">So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from <script type="math/tex">C</script> than <script type="math/tex">wb/\sqrt {v^2-w^2}</script> then you always want to
cut across the sand when you are a distance <script type="math/tex">wb/\sqrt {v^2-w^2}</script> from point <script type="math/tex">C</script>. If you start closer than this
to <script type="math/tex">C</script>, you should cut directly across the sand.
